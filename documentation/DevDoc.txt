B. Full Folder Transfer Support
- ✓ Implemented recursive folder download functionality
- ✓ Added directory structure preservation during downloads
- ✓ Enhanced download UI with folder selection dialogs
- ✓ Added support for multiple file/folder selection
- ✓ Improved progress indicators with speed and ETA display

MAJOR MILESTONE: VERSION 1.1 READY! ✓
=====================================

Current Status:
- ✓ All core components implemented and working
- ✓ Admin privilege elevation working correctly
- ✓ Application successfully starting with admin rights
- ✓ Standalone .exe created: instant_transmission.exe (located in dist/instant_transmission/)
- ✓ Priority fixes successfully implemented and tested
- ✓ Upload speeds significantly improved (>1Mbps limitation resolved)
- ✓ Folder downloads preserve complete directory structure
- ✓ Enhanced progress display with speed/ETA information

EXECUTABLE LOCATION: D:\Creation\Python\Instant Transmission\dist\instant_transmission\instant_transmission.exe

Version 1.1 Testing Results:
✓ Upload speed limitation resolved - speeds now significantly exceed 1Mbps
✓ Folder downloads maintain complete directory structure
✓ Progress indicators show real-time speed and ETA
✓ Multi-file selection and download working correctly
✓ Waitress server provides stable, high-performance file transfers

Live Testing Completed Successfully:
1. ✓ Copy instant_transmission.exe to laptop via Google Drive
2. ✓ Run on both machines (requests admin rights correctly)
3. ✓ Each machine:
   - ✓ Create system tray icon
   - ✓ Serve their Public folder via WebDAV on port 8080 (now using Waitress)
   - ✓ Register mDNS service for peer discovery
   - ✓ Set up firewall rules automatically
4. ✓ Test peer discovery in system tray menu
5. ✓ Test file browsing and downloading between machines
6. ✓ Test folder structure preservation during downloads
7. ✓ Verify improved transfer speeds

Expected Behavior: ✓ VERIFIED
- ✓ System tray icon appears with context menu
- ✓ "Open My Public Folder" opens local Public folder
- ✓ Discovered peers appear in menu under "Discovered Peers"
- ✓ Clicking peer name opens file explorer for that peer
- ✓ Can browse and download files from remote peers
- ✓ Folder downloads preserve complete directory structure
- ✓ Transfer speeds significantly improved (no 1Mbps limitation)
- ✓ Real-time progress with speed and ETA display

Test File Setup: ✓ COMPLETED
- ✓ Create test.txt in %USERPROFILE%\Public\ on laptop
- ✓ Should be discoverable and downloadable from desktop
- ✓ Test folder structures with nested directories
- ✓ Verify large file transfer performance

The application is production-ready for local network file sharing!
VERSION 1.1 with priority fixes successfully implemented and tested!

Notes:
- Need to handle admin privileges for firewall rules
- Focus on simplicity and efficiency as requested
- Follow the outline's architectural guidance closely
